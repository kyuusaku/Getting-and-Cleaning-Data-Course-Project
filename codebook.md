CodeBook
========================================================
This codebook describes the variables found in the tidy dataset generated by running `run_analysis.R` does the following. 

        1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
        4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Original Data

### <a style='color:green'>Data Collection Description</a>
The original data set was obtained from [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]

It is described as a "Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors."

The experiments involved 30 subjects. Each subject performed six activities (<b>WALKING</b>, <b>WALKING_UPSTAIRS</b>, <b>WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS</b>, <b>SITTING</b>, <b>STANDING</b>, <b>LAYING</b>) with a sensor-equipped smartphone attached to their waist. The smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope they used to capture 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the `training data` and 30% the `test data`. 

See the above website for further details on sensor signal pre-processing if you are interested.

### <a style='color:green'>Required files</a>

- `train/subject_train.txt`, `test/subject_test.txt`: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

        train [1 3 5 6 7 8 11 14 15 16 17 19 21 22 23 25 26 27 28 29 30]
        test  [2 4 9 10 12 13 18 20 24]

- `activity_labels.txt`: Links the class labels with their activity name.

|WALKING|WALKING_UPSTAIRS|WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS|SITTING|STANDING|LAYING|
|:-----:|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-----:|:------:|:----:|
|   1   |       2        |        3         |   4   |   5    |  6   |

- `train/y_train.txt`, `test/y_test.txt`: Each row identifies the class label of an activity. Its range is from 1 to 6.

- `features.txt`: List of all features. And the tidy data includes only the measurements on the `mean` and `standard deviation` for each measurement

- `train/X_train.txt`, `test/X_test.txt`: Training and test set. Each row is a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

## Tidy Data

This picture comes from <b>Course Discussion Forums</b>. It illustrates the relationship between the <b>original data</b> and the <b>tidy data</b>. And in this project, `subject.id` and `activity` are moved to the first and second colums. 

### <a style='color:green'>Complete list of variables by column number</a>

Note that I have cleaned the original variable names for better readability/understanding.  See the 'Style' section in README for more info if necessary.
